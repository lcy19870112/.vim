VARIABLES CONTROLLING USAGE		*engspchk-var* *engspchk-variable*
					*engspchk-variables*

	g:cvimsyn : If this vim variable is set, then it holds the directory
		    path to the user word database <engspchk.usr>.  If it
		    doesn't exist, then engspchk will look for a system
		    environment variable called CVIMSYN (see below).  For
		    example, under a Windows operating system, one might have
		    in one's <.vimrc> file:

	    	let g:cvimsyn= 'c:\vim\vim61\CVIMSYN'

	    or under Unix/Linux, one might have

	    	let g:cvimsyn= "${HOME}/.vim/CVIMSYN"

	CVIMSYN   : points to a directory holding the user word database
	    <engspchk.usr> The optional file <engspchk.wb>, which contains
	    words from Webster's 1913 Dictionary that aren't in engspchk
	    itself, if present in the CVIMSYN directory, will also be loaded.

	    If neither g:cvimsyn nor $CVIMSYN are defined, then <engspchk>
	    will look in the first directory specified by the runtimepath
	    (to see your runtimepath, :echo &rtp)

	g:DrChipTopLvlMenu: by default its "DrChip"; you may set this to
	    whatever you like in your <.vimrc>.  This variable controls
	    where engspchk's menu items are placed.

	g:spchklang : specifies which language/dictionaries are to be used.
	    By default it will be the prefix of the <---spchk.vim> file
	    (engspchk.vim -> eng, gerspchk.vim -> ger, frspchk.vim -> fr,
	    etc).  You may override that with a different prefix in your
	    <.vimrc>.  When you load <engspchk.vim> (via \ec) the prefix will
	    be used to load the dictionaries: <engspchk.dict>, <engspchk.usr>,
	    <gerspchk.dict>, <gerspchk.usr>, etc.

	    For example, one may put into one's <.vimrc> file:

	    	let g:spchklang= "eng"

	g:spchkpunc =0 : no new behavior
                    =1 : check for some simple English punctuation problems
                         non-capitalized word after ellipse (... a)
                         non-capitalized word after sentence ending character
			 ([.?!])

	g:spchk_autonext : if this variable exists, then the maps \et, \es,
	    and \ea will automatically jump to the next spelling error.  The
	    latter (\ea) will only do a jump if an alternate word is selected.


INCLUDED MAPS					*engspchk-maps* *engspchk-map*

	Although the maps as discussed here show a backslash, the actual
	maps for 6.0 and above use <Leader> (ie. see :help mapleader for more)
	which allows you to customize the map leader character sequence.  By
	default, of course, the <Leader> is a backslash.

	\et : add    word under cursor into user dictionary (temporarily)
	\eT : remove word under cursor from user dictionary (temporarily)
	\es : save   word under cursor into user dictionary (permanently)
	\eS : remove word under cursor from user dictionary (permanently)
	\en : move cursor to the next     spelling error
	\ep : move cursor to the previous spelling error
	\ea : look for alternative spellings of word under cursor

	The \es map will store <engspchk.usr> in the directory where
	<engspchk.dict> is.  To do so it must be able to find the directory;
	ie. typically g:cvimsyn must be set to the correct path or the
	environment variable CVIMSYN must be appropriately set.  For vim 6.0
	or later, the CVIMSYN directory under the first directory in the
	|runtimepath| may be used.

	The \et map adds the word under the cursor into the spelling
	database only for the current session.  It acts by adding
	the word to the GoodWord keyword list but doesn't save the
	word to the user's <engspchk.usr> database.  The \es map
	both adds the word to the GoodWord keyword list and adds
	a line to the <engspchk.usr> database for future use.

MAPS FOR ALTERNATIVES WINDOW ONLY			*engspchk-alt*

	<cr> : when on alternatives line, will put word under cursor in
	      misspelled word's stead
	:q   : will quit the alternate-word window

	In order to generate alternative spellings engspchk uses agrep.
	Source code for agrep can be found at:

	Windows binary:
	  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/text/agrep-2.04.tar.Z

	Source:
	  http://www.tgries.de/agrep

	To use this feature, assuming one has an agrep executable, put the
	cursor on a misspelled word, then type "\ea".  A list of alternative
	spellings will appear on one line on the bottom of the screen.  Use
	regular vim motions to put the cursor on the word that you want and
	hit the <return> key.  This action should put the new word in the
	stead of the misspelled word.  A ":q" will abort the alternative-word
	spellings window.

USAGE							*engspchk-usage*

	Press "\ec" or select "Load Engspchk" from the menu (gvim).  This will
	finish loading <engspchk.vim>, load <engspchk.dict>, and optionally
	load <engspchk.wb> (if present) and <engspchk.usr> (if present).
	Spelling errors will then show up in Error highlighting.  Of course
	you'll need to have "syntax on" for this to work (put that statement
	into your <.vimrc> if it isn't already there!).

	If you come across a word that's mistakenly highlighted as a
	spelling error, put the cursor on it and tap "\et" or "\es" while in
	Normal mode.

	The first command will inform Engspchk that the word is spelled
	right, but only for the duration of this particular session.  If you
	want the word to be permanently remembered, use the second command
	"\es" (for engspchk save).

	To go to the next or previous spelling error, use "\en" or "\ep"
	commands respectively.  If upon inspection of a word that's spelled
	incorrectly you're not sure of the correct spelling, you can use the
	alternative spellings feature (see |engspchk-alt|).

	Engspchk does _not_ do a "syntax clear", so that means that you can
	usually just source it in on top of other highlighting.

	Most syntax highlighting files, however, _do_ use "syntax clear" so
	that means that resetting syntax (:set ft=..., changing buffers, etc)
	will clear out engspchk.  One way to avoid this is to use

		:%d
		:0r (filename)

	The user dictionary <engspchk.usr> is generated in the directory
	specified by path specified by the g:cvimsyn variable (or CVIMSYN
	environment variable).  Merely place the cursor on a word that's
	currently not in your dictionary and press "\es".


CHECKING SPELLING IN COMMENTS				*engspchk-comment*

	In order to spell-check comments in various computer languages, the
	language's vim syntax file needs to have its comment syntax group
	contain a cluster.  Engspchk can then add itself to that cluster.
	The vim syntax languages that currently support this include:

	    amiga	c	dcl	latex	tex
	    bash	cpp	fortran	sh	vim
	    bib	csh	ksh

	If there's a language for which you'd like to have comments
	spelling-checked that isn't on the above list, please contact that
	vim syntax file's maintainer and ask for the support mentioned above.


==============================================================================
3. Other Languages					*engspchk-language*

	There are versions of this script for other languages.  If you come
	up with a version for another language, please let me know where on
	the web it is so that I can help make it known.  The following
	versions were based on earlier editions of <engspchk.vim>:

	 Dutch    : http://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/tip.php?tip_id=161
	 German   : http://jeanluc-picard.de/vim/gerspchk/gerspchk.vim.gz
	 Hungarian: http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=22
	 Polish   : http://strony.wp.pl/wp/kostoo/polspchk.tar.gz
	 Yiddish  : http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/vim.tar.gz


CREATING A NEW VERSION OF ENGSPCHK			*engspchk-newversion*

	The <engspchk.vim> file should be renamed to reflect the new language
	being supported: ex. gerspchk.vim  for German.  The prefix (ie. "ger")
	will be used in menus and for the user word database
	(ie., gerspchk.usr).

	Of course, the appropriate dictionary file (ie., gerspchk.dict) must
	also be present in the CVIMSYN subdirectory.
